# BJCP-Style-Guide-to-BeerXML

Python scrip that converted the BJCP Style Guide in xml to a BeerXML format

In the BJCP Guide there is no Type, so The program will guess on the name if it is an ale or a lager, otherwise it will put unknown, you must manually edit those.

The guide also puts carbonation levels as a default value because that is not available in the style guide, but needed it for it to be valid beerXML
